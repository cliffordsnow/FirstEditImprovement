# First Edit Improvement Process

The goal is to improve first edits by documenting quality errors on new mappers. The software only runs on linux but could possibly be modified to run on macOS. 

### Requirements
*  linux
*  osmapi python module
*  cvs python module
*  time python module
*  Pidgin IRC client - not available in macOS
*  shuf - not available in macOS
*  python

This hasn't been tested on macOS. [Adium](http://adium.im) might replace pidgin since it uses libpurple, the core code of pidgin, for much of its protocol support. Shuf can be installed using the command:```
brew install coreutils
```
